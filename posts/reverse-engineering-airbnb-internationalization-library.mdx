Curiosity is one of the most essential developer's assets. By being curious and experimenting with things, you make sure you're continually learning and upgrading your skills. A few weeks ago, I had to implement internationalization for an app I was working on. I chose to use [Polyglot](http://airbnb.io/polyglot.js/) because of its simplicity. It's also created by Airbnb, a company with many great [open sources libraries](https://airbnb.io/projects/).

When I used Polyglot, I wondered what was going on under the hood. So I decided to do a little bit of reverse-engineering by diving into the source code. And here I am, sharing with you what I've learned along the way.

You'll find many code snippets below. Most of them come from the [source code of Polyglot](https://github.com/airbnb/polyglot.js/blob/master/index.js) itself. This article aims to give you more explanations about that code, its purpose, and its use.

## Recap about the library

But first, let's do a recap about the library. Basically, Polyglot handles the internationalization of your app including **interpolation** and **pluralization**. You give it a set of translated phrases and you retrieve the ones you want using a special function called `t`:

```javascript
const polyglot = new Polyglot({
  phrases: {
    hello: "Hello",
    morning: "Morning",
    auth: {
      login: "Login",
      register: "Register",
    },
  },
});

polyglot.t("hello"); // Hello
polyglot.t("morning"); // Morning
polyglot.t("auth.login"); // Login
```

Notice how Polyglot handles **nested objects.**

If you want to add more phrases to the Polyglot instance, you can use the `extend` method:

```javascript
Polyglot.extend({
  bye: "Bye!",
});
```

Polyglot supports **interpolation**. Roughly speaking, it consists in replacing some placeholders in your phrase by a real value:

```javascript
polyglot.extend({
  welcome: "Welcome %{name}",
});

polyglot.t("welcome", { name: "Thomas" }); // Welcome Thomas
```

If you don't provide one of the interpolation value, Polyglot will return your placeholder as-is. It can be useful if you want to do partial interpolation:

```javascript
Polyglot.extend({
  user: "My name is %{name}. I love %{hobby}!",
});

polyglot.t("user", { name: "Thomas" }); // My name is Thomas. I love %{hobby}
```

You can also provide your own interpolation syntax:

```javascript
const polyglot = new Polyglot({
  interpolation: { prefix: "{{", suffix: "}}" },
});

polyglot.extend({
  city: "You live in {{city}}",
});

polyglot.t("city", { city: "London" }); // You live in London
```

Finally, Polyglot handles pluralization, that is to say, express a sentence in the plural form. To make it work properly, Polyglot needs a locale (which is `en` by default):

```javascript
polyglot.locale(); // 'en'
polyglot.extend({
  thing: "There is %{smart_count} thing |||| There are %{smart_count} things",
});

polyglot.t("thing", { smart_count: 1 }); // There is 1 thing
```

Giving a number as a second argument also works:

```javascript
Polyglot.t("thing", 4); // There are 4 things
```

If you need to set the locale, you have two choices:

- Call the `locale` method with its corresponding code
- Provide the locale during the instantiation

```javascript
polyglot.locale("fr");
// OR
const polyglot = new Polyglot({ locale: "fr" });
```

What's great is that Polyglot supports many locales, dozens of locales!

And then the less-used features:

- `unset` to remove a key from Polyglot's phrases
- `clear` to remove all the phrases from the Polyglot instance
- `replace` to replace the current phrases with others
- `has` to check if a translation exists for a given key

```javascript
polyglot.unset("hello");
polyglot.unset({
  hello: "Hello",
  auth: {
    register: "Register",
  },
});

polyglot.replace({
  hello: "Hey!",
  bye: "Bye-bye",
});

polyglot.clear();

polyglot.has("hello"); // true
```

You may think that the translation itself is easy to do. In fact, it's just returning a value of an object based on a key. But what about nested key objects? The interpolation feature? Or the pluralization? And handling the pluralization for all the locales? 🤔

Don't worry, we'll figure it out right away.

## Translate a simple phrase

Let's start with the simplest feature: translate a simple phrase. It's as easy as getting a key from an object. Internally, when you create an instance of Polyglot, an empty `phrases` object is created. You can then extend it by providing some phrases in the `options` object:

```javascript
function Polyglot(options) {
  var opts = options || {};
  this.phrases = {};
  this.extend(opts.phrases || {});
  // ...
}
```

We instanciate Polyglot like this:

```javascript
const polyglot = new Polyglot(); // phrases -> {}
const polyglot = new Polyglot({ phrases: { hello: "Hello" } }); // extend({hello: 'Hello'}) is called
```

Polyglot makes use of **short-circuit evaluation**. This complicated term means JavaScript takes advantage of logical operators such as `||` (OR) to evaluate just what's necessary. Thus, if `options` is `undefined` or `null`, JavaScript will assign `{}` to `opts` as the first operand evaluates to false. But if `options` is set, it won't even look at the rest of the expression and assign `options` to `opts`.

Polyglot uses `extend` to map a given key to a given phrase in its internal `phrases` object. We'll come back to it in a few moments.

Other things happen when you instanciate Polyglot including this:

```javascript
function Polyglot(options) {
  var opts = options || {};
  // ...
  this.currentLocale = opts.locale || "en";
  // ...
  this.tokenRegex = constructTokenRegex(opts.interpolation);
}
```

The `currentLocale` is set to a given locale or `en` and a mysterious `tokenRegex` is created. These properties are important for interpolation and pluralization.

Then, when we'll call `t` with a given key, Polyglot will search its associated value in the internal `phrases` object. Once found, it will apply to the phrase some transformations (interpolation and pluralization) and return it:

```javascript
Polyglot.prototype.t = function (key, options) {
  var phrase, result;
  var opts = options == null ? {} : options;
  if (typeof this.phrases[key] === "string") {
    phrase = this.phrases[key];
  }
  // ...
  if (typeof phrase === "string") {
    result = transformPhrase(phrase, opts, this.currentLocale, this.tokenRegex);
  }
  return result;
};
```

_"What an odd way to declare a method"_, you might say. Why not simply use the `class` keyword?

Because JavaScript is continuously evolving. When this library was written, there were no such things as classes (as well as `const` and `let`). It was only introduced in 2015. So we had to create classes by using **constructor functions**.

But, functions being functions, it's not efficient to put all methods inside a constructor function. That would mean that every function inside the constructor function would be created at each instantiation!

That's why there is a `prototype` property inside every function: **by putting a method in the `prototype` property, you share it across all instances of your function.** Check out [this resource](https://tylermcginnis.com/beginners-guide-to-javascript-prototype/) to learn more about prototypes.

By the way, classes in JavaScript are also **constructor functions.** Go ahead and define a `class`. You'll see its type is `Function`. Interesting, isn't it?

## Extend

The most attentive of you will think _"But what if our `phrases` object has inner objects? I don't see how `t` handles the nested objects? It only transforms the phrase if the type of the phrase is a string, right?"_

That's a legit question. As said in the recap, Polyglot handles nested phrases objects. Under the hood, It uses the `extend` method to add new phrases to the instance. This method recursively processes all the keys in the object passed as an argument and puts them at the root level of the internal `phrases` object. Each nested key is concatenated with the one that's one level above it using the dot notation:

```javascript
var forEach = require("for-each");

// ...

Polyglot.prototype.extend = function (morePhrases, prefix) {
  forEach(
    morePhrases,
    function (phrase, key) {
      var prefixedKey = prefix ? prefix + "." + key : key;
      if (typeof phrase === "object") {
        this.extend(phrase, prefixedKey);
      } else {
        this.phrases[prefixedKey] = phrase;
      }
    },
    this
  );
};
```

**Note**: Polyglot uses a package called [for-each](https://github.com/Raynos/for-each) to iterate over both objects and arrays. It acts as a polyfill so that Polyglot doesn't require added methods like `Array.prototype.forEach`. Suppose you wonder what the third `this` argument passed to `forEach` is. In that case, it allows specifying what is `this` in the callback function (the second argument). In our case, `this` refers to an instance of Polyglot.

Let's see what happens if you call `extend` like this:

```javascript
polyglot.extend({
  hello: "Hello",
  auth: {
    login: "Login",
    register: "Register",
  },
});
```

- For the `hello` key, `prefix` will be `undefined` so `prefixedKey = hello`. The corresponding `phrase` (`Hello`) is a string, so we map `Hello` to `hello` in the internal `phrases`.

- For `auth`, there is still no prefix, so `prefixedKey = auth`. However, `phrase` is an object, so we'll recursively call `extend` with `phrase` and `prefixedKey`: `this.extend({ login: 'Login', register: 'Register' }, 'auth')`.

- For `login`, there is a prefix which is `auth`, so `prefixedKey = auth.login`. Here `phrase` is a string so we map `Login` to `auth.login` in the internal `phrases`.

- It's exactly the same behavior for `register`.

That way, you make sure you traverse all your objects and map every key to a string value in the **flattened** `phrases` object. After calling `extend`, your `phrases` look like this:

```javascript
{
  hello: 'Hello',
  auth.login: 'Login',
  auth.register: 'Register'
}
```

Note that `extend` actually extends the `phrases` object and **doesn't replace it.** The only things that can be replaced are the conflicting keys. For example, if you call `extend` with an object with a `hello` key and that key already exists in `phrases`, the old key will be replaced with the new one.

## Interpolation

Let's come back to `transformPhrase`, shall we? You may remember that we use it in the `t` function to transform the phrase we get via our key:

```javascript
if (typeof phrase === "string") {
  result = transformPhrase(phrase, opts, this.currentLocale, this.tokenRegex);
}
```

We'll dive into its code to understand how one can build the interpolation feature.

Here, the interpolation feature consists of replacing a generic word with another one in an object. What's great is that [`String.prototype.replace`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/replace) does most of the work for us. Indeed, according to MDN, The `replace` method returns a new string with some or all matches of a pattern replaced by a replacement. You just need to define a regular expression to capture what you need to replace and fetch the corresponding word in the `options` object.

```javascript
var has = require("has");

// ...

var replace = String.prototype.replace;

// ...

var defaultTokenRegex = /%\{(.*?)\}/g;

function transformPhrase(phrase, substitutions, locale, tokenRegex) {
  // ...

  var result = phrase;
  var interpolationRegex = tokenRegex || defaultTokenRegex;

  var options =
    typeof substitutions === "number"
      ? { smart_count: substitutions }
      : substitutions;

  result = replace.call(
    result,
    interpolationRegex,
    function (expression, argument) {
      if (!has(options, argument) || options[argument] == null) {
        return expression;
      }
      return replace.call(options[argument], dollarRegex, dollarBillsYall);
    }
  );

  return result;
}
```

This is how interpolation is done under the hood. Not less, not more. But you may be unfamiliar with things like `call` or `String.prototype.replace`.

Three essential things are done before calling `transformPhrase`:

- We **require** the `has` package which is a shortcut for `Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call`.
- We **cache** the `String.prototype.replace` method.
- We create the `defaultRegexToken` used to match the generic words in our phrases. Basically, this regex means _"match anything that is included inside `%{}`"_. Note that this regular expression is **lazy** (`.*?`) instead of **greedy** (`.*`). In other words, it means this regexp will capture the smallest group possible.

That being said, we can learn how `transformPhrase` behaves.

It takes four parameters: `phrase`, `substitutions`, `locale` and `tokenRegex`. We won't need `locale` for now as it's needed for pluralization. Then, we assign to `interpolationRegex` the regex that will be used for the replacements. It can be a custom regex (remember the mysterious `tokenRegex` in the constructor?) or the `defaultTokenRegex` explained above.

Beforehand, we assign to `options` the value of `substitutions`. The `typeof` check is done for pluralization. You don't have to care about it for now.

Then, we actually replace the phrase using the regular expression. As the `replace` function is cached, we need to use the `call` method to specify on which string we want to invoke the `replace` function, that is to say, `result`. If using `call` confuses you, it's the same as:

```javascript
result = result.replace(interpolationRegex, function (expression, argument) {
  if (!has(options, argument) || options[argument] == null) {
    return expression;
  }
  return replace.call(options[argument], dollarRegex, dollarBillsYall);
});
```

The second argument of `replace` can either have the form of a string or a function. Here we use the function because we need to retrieve the eventual generic word's value in the options. This function will be run on every match with the following arguments:

- `expression`: refers to the match itself, `%{name}` for example.
- `argument`: refers to the captured group (`(.*?)`), that is to say, everything inside the interpolation syntax. By default, it is everything inside `%{}`.

If the captured string is a property of the `options` object passed to `t` and is different than `null`, then we return its associated value otherwise, we return the expression itself. The returned value will be used as a replacement for the match.

Let's apply it on an example to fully understand it:

```javascript
Polyglot.extend({
  user: "Hi, your name is %{name}. You are a %{job} and you like %{hobby}.",
});

polyglot.t("user", {
  name: "Thomas",
  hobby: "traveling",
});
```

We assume we haven't provided any custom interpolation syntax to Polyglot. Then, `interpolationRegex` is equal to `/%\{(.*?)\}/g`.

We call `replace` on the phrase `'Hi, your name is %{name}. You are a %{job} and you like %{hobby}.'`. We'll have three matches: `%{name}`, `%{job}` and `%{hobby}`. For every match, we run `replace`'s callback function:

1. `expression` = `%{name}`, `argument` = `name`. Is `name` in the options object? **Yes**, then return the associated value: `Thomas`.
2. `expression` = `%{job}`, `argument` = `job`. Is `job` in the options object? No, return the expression: `%{job}`.
3. `expression` = `%{hobby}`, `argument` = `hobby`. Is `hobby` in the options object? Yes, then return the associated value: `traveling`.

The result of the translation is: `Hi, your name is Thomas. You are a %{job}, and you like traveling.` That's not rocket science, after all! 😉

### Custom interpolation syntax

We saw how to implement interpolation. Let's see how to customize the interpolation syntax. Indeed, Polyglot allows you to customize the prefix and the suffix so that you can use `{{name}}` or `|name|` instead of `%{name}`.

_"Easy"_, you might think. _"Just change the regex!_". And you would be right. That's what Polyglot does. It uses a custom regex called `tokenRegex` that is built when you create an instance of Polyglot:

```javascript
function Polyglot(options) {
  var opts = options || {};
  // ...
  this.tokenRegex = constructTokenRegex(opts.interpolation);
}
```

This `tokenRegex` is then passed to `transformPhrase` when you call `t` on a key. It is assigned to `interpolationRegex` if it holds a value:

```javascript
function transformPhrase(phrase, substitutions, locale, tokenRegex) {
  // ...
  var interpolationRegex = tokenRegex || defaultTokenRegex;
  // ...
}
```

`constructTokenRegex` is a fairly simple function. Its purpose is to return a new regex based on the given prefix and suffix:

```javascript
var delimiter = "||||";

// ...

function escape(token) {
  return token.replace(/[.*+?^${}()|[\]\\]/g, "\\$&");
}

function constructTokenRegex(opts) {
  var prefix = (opts && opts.prefix) || "%{";
  var suffix = (opts && opts.suffix) || "}";

  if (prefix === delimiter || suffix === delimiter) {
    throw new RangeError(
      '"' + delimiter + '" token is reserved for pluralization'
    );
  }

  return new RegExp(escape(prefix) + "(.*?)" + escape(suffix), "g");
}
```

There are two things to consider, though:

- It's not possible to choose a prefix or a suffix that is equal to `||||` as it's used for pluralization.
- We **must escape** the prefix and the suffix. But why is that? Well, you'll probably use special characters such as `{`, or `[` or maybe `*`. However, these symbols are special regex characters, so we need to escape them with a backslash. That's the responsibility of the `escape` function. It will replace the regex symbol with a backslash followed by the matched symbol (corresponds to `$&`).

As an example, `constructTokenRegex({ prefix: '[[', suffix: ']]' })` returns `/\[\[(.*?)\]\]/g` (and not `/[[(.*?)]]/g` ⚠️).

## Smart count and plural groups

Now the second part of `transformPhrase`: pluralization. That one can be tough to build. Indeed, you have to make it possible for Polyglot to choose a phrase among others both based on a number and a locale. But a language can be radically different from another, plural forms included. For example, did you know that there are no plural forms in Chinese, but there are six in Arabic? Or that in French, zero is singular while it's plural in English? To make pluralization happen, we need to take account of all these rules.

**Note**: If you're interested, here are the other [plural rules](http://www.unicode.org/cldr/charts/33/supplemental/language_plural_rules.html).

Roughly speaking, here's what Polyglot does:

1. Reference all possible rules and map them to the corresponding locales.
2. When you translate a phrase that need to be pluralized (with the `smart_count` option), split it in multiple phrases based on a delimiter. Thus, you get an array of phrases (more precisely, all the plural forms of the phrase).
3. Retrieve the rule associated with the locale given to Polyglot. This rule takes a number as a parameter and returns another number indicating which plural form to choose.
4. Returns the correct phrase using the number returned by the rule (which acts as an **array index**).

We are going to detail this step by step.

First, here is an extract of all the rules and their corresponding locales:

```javascript
var russianPluralGroups = function (n) {
  var lastTwo = n % 100;
  var end = lastTwo % 10;
  if (lastTwo !== 11 && end === 1) {
    return 0;
  }
  if (2 <= end && end <= 4 && !(lastTwo >= 12 && lastTwo <= 14)) {
    return 1;
  }
  return 2;
};

var pluralTypes = {
  arabic: function (n) {
    // http://www.arabeyes.org/Plural_Forms
    if (n < 3) {
      return n;
    }
    var lastTwo = n % 100;
    if (lastTwo >= 3 && lastTwo <= 10) return 3;
    return lastTwo >= 11 ? 4 : 5;
  },
  bosnian_serbian: russianPluralGroups,
  chinese: function () {
    return 0;
  },
  croatian: russianPluralGroups,
  french: function (n) {
    return n > 1 ? 1 : 0;
  },
  german: function (n) {
    return n !== 1 ? 1 : 0;
  },
  // ...
};

var pluralTypeToLanguages = {
  arabic: ["ar"],
  bosnian_serbian: ["bs-Latn-BA", "bs-Cyrl-BA", "srl-RS", "sr-RS"],
  chinese: [
    "id",
    "id-ID",
    "ja",
    "ko",
    "ko-KR",
    "lo",
    "ms",
    "th",
    "th-TH",
    "zh",
  ],
  croatian: ["hr", "hr-HR"],
  german: [
    "fa",
    "da",
    "de",
    "en",
    "es",
    "fi",
    "el",
    "he",
    "hi-IN",
    "hu",
    "hu-HU",
    "it",
    "nl",
    "no",
    "pt",
    "sv",
    "tr",
  ],
  french: ["fr", "tl", "pt-br"],
  // ...
};
```

You can see, for example, that for a german rule (which includes English), we return the plural form if the number is different than one, otherwise, we return the singular form.

Now we can focus on the pluralization part of `transformPhrase`. Here we will take account of the `locale` parameter. The `currentLocale` value of Polyglot is passed to `transformPhrase` when calling `t`:

```javascript
if (typeof phrase === "string") {
  result = transformPhrase(phrase, opts, this.currentLocale, this.tokenRegex);
}
```

To make pluralization happen, you need to add a `smart_count` in your options (`substitutions` object). Note that you can also pass a number instead of an options object. Polyglot will take that shortcut and transform it back to an options object with a `smart_count` property.

```javascript
var trim = require("string.prototype.trim");

// ...

var split = String.prototype.split;

// ...

var delimiter = "||||";

// ...

function transformPhrase(phrase, substitutions, locale, tokenRegex) {
  // ...

  if (substitutions == null) {
    return phrase;
  }

  var result = phrase;

  var options =
    typeof substitutions === "number"
      ? { smart_count: substitutions }
      : substitutions;

  if (options.smart_count != null && result) {
    var texts = split.call(result, delimiter);
    result = trim(
      texts[pluralTypeIndex(locale || "en", options.smart_count)] || texts[0]
    );
  }

  // Interpolation code...

  return result;
}
```

**Step two**. If we do have a `smart_count` option, we split the phrase into multiple parts thanks to the delimiter (`||||`). As we are caching `split`, we need to invoke the `result` function thanks to the `call` method. For example:

```javascript
var phrase = "I have one thing |||| I have many things";
phrases.split("||||"); // ['I have one thing ', ' I have many things']
```

Then, **step 3**. We need to retrieve the rule associated with our locale. This happens thanks to the `pluralTypeIndex` function.

Basically, `pluralTypeIndex` takes a locale and a count. It invokes one of the functions defined in `pluralTypes` with `count` as a parameter. It can be `arabic(3)`, for example.

```javascript
function pluralTypeIndex(locale, count) {
  return pluralTypes[pluralTypeName(locale)](count);
}
```

Nevertheless, we need to know beforehand which language rules our locale refers to. That's what `pluralTypeName` does.

```javascript
function langToTypeMap(mapping) {
  var ret = {};
  forEach(mapping, function (langs, type) {
    forEach(langs, function (lang) {
      ret[lang] = type;
    });
  });
  return ret;
}

function pluralTypeName(locale) {
  var langToPluralType = langToTypeMap(pluralTypeToLanguages);
  return (
    langToPluralType[locale] ||
    langToPluralType[split.call(locale, /-/, 1)[0]] ||
    langToPluralType.en
  );
}
```

After building the map that associates a locale to the correct plural rule, we lookup in this map for the value of the given locale.

You have to deal with one edge case here. Indeed, the locale can sometimes be composed and missing in the corresponding map. In that case, we first try to return the rule associated with the first part of the locale. Otherwise, we return the one associated to `en` (`german`).

If you struggle to see what the `langToPluralType` map looks like, here is an extract:

```javascript
{
  ar: 'arabic',
  'bs-Latn-BA': 'bosnian_serbian',
  'bs-Cyrl-BA': 'bosnian_serbian',
  'srl-RS': 'bosnian_serbian',
  'sr-RS': 'bosnian_serbian',
  id: 'chinese',
  'id-ID': 'chinese',
  // ...
  'th-TH': 'chinese',
  zh: 'chinese',
  hr: 'croatian',
  'hr-HR': 'croatian',
  fa: 'german',
  da: 'german',
  de: 'german',
  en: 'german',
  // ...
}
```

Let's say we have `fa` as a locale. Invoking `pluralTypeName` will lookup in the map above if `fa` is mapped to a value. It turns out it is, so it will return `german`.

However, in the case of `en-US`, it doesn't correspond to anything in the map, so it will split this locale based on `-`, and will retrieve the first part of it: `en`. Thus, we have a locale to look for in the map.

Finally, in `pluralTypeIndex`, we can invoke the correct language rule to the function with the count. The result of that function will be trimed as there may be some whitespaces between the end (or beginning) of the phrase and `||||`.

**Note**: We are thinking in terms of indexes. It implies that your phrases should be delimited in ascending order and that you should be exhaustive on the possible plural forms your phrase may take. Otherwise, Polyglot may just return the first phrase.

Let's recap pluralization on an example:

```javascript
const polyglot = new Polyglot();
polyglot.extend({
  thing: "There is %{smart_count} thing |||| There are %{smart_count} things",
});

polyglot.t("thing", { smart_count: 1 });
```

We haven't provided a `locale` to polyglot, so it's `en` by default.

1. Is there a `smart_count` on the `options` or is it a number? Yes, let's know which phrase to return.
2. Split the phrase in multiple phrases: `['There is %{smart_count} thing ', ' There are %{smart_count} things']`
3. After building the `langToPluralType` map, we retrieve the plural rule associated to `en`, that is to say `german`.
4. Let's invoke the `german` function with the correct count: `german(1)`
5. The german rule checks the following: `n !== 1 ? 1 : 0`. Here, `1` is not different from `1`, then return `0`.
6. Select the first phrase (index `0`) from the multiple phrases and trim it: `There is %{smart_count} thing`.
7. Interpolation: replace `smart_count` in the phrase: `There is 1 thing`.

Another example:

```javascript
const polyglot = new Polyglot({ locale: "fr" });
polyglot.extend({
  thing: "Il n'y a rien |||| Il y a plein de choses",
});

polyglot.t("thing", 4);
```

Here the `locale` is `fr`.

1. Is there a `smart_count` on the `options` or is it a number? Yes, let's know which phrase to return.
2. Split the phrase in multiple phrases: `["Il n'y a rien ", " Il y a plein de choses"]`
3. After building the `langToPluralType` map, we retrieve the plural rule associated to `fr`, that is to say `french`.
4. Let's invoke the `french` function with the correct count: `french(4)`
5. The french rule checks the following: `n > 1 ? 1 : 0`. Here, `4` is greater than `1`, then return `1`.
6. Select the second phrase (index `1`) from the multiple phrases and trim it: `Il y a plein de choses`.

## Other features

Are you still with me? Great. The next methods are pretty easy to understand. They act more as utilities instead as a feature on their own.

### Unset

`unset` is quite similar to `extend` code-wise. It takes a parameter that can either be a string or an object. If it's a string, delete the key from the internal `phrases` object. If it's an object, iterate over the keys of the object passed and remove them if the associated value if it's not an object. Otherwise, apply the unset function on the associated object value:

```javascript
Polyglot.prototype.unset = function (morePhrases, prefix) {
  if (typeof morePhrases === "string") {
    delete this.phrases[morePhrases];
  } else {
    forEach(
      morePhrases,
      function (phrase, key) {
        var prefixedKey = prefix ? prefix + "." + key : key;
        if (typeof phrase === "object") {
          this.unset(phrase, prefixedKey);
        } else {
          delete this.phrases[prefixedKey];
        }
      },
      this
    );
  }
};
```

### Clear

As you have an internal `phrases` object that contains all your keys and phrases, `clear` is fairly simple. Just empty the object:

```javascript
Polyglot.prototype.clear = function () {
  this.phrases = {};
};
```

### Replace

`replace` allows you to replace your current set of phrases by another one. So you just need to **clear** the current `phrases` and **extend** it with the other set:

```javascript
Polyglot.prototype.replace = function (newPhrases) {
  this.clear();
  this.extend(newPhrases);
};
```

### Has

As we already require an `has` package that checks for a key in an object, we just have to apply the `has` function on the internal `phrases` with a given key:

```javascript
Polyglot.prototype.has = function (key) {
  return has(this.phrases, key);
};
```

### Locale

The `locale` method has two behaviors:

- If a new locale is provided, set the internal `currentLocale` to it.
- Otherwise, return the current locale.

```javascript
Polyglot.prototype.locale = function (newLocale) {
  if (newLocale) this.currentLocale = newLocale;
  return this.currentLocale;
};
```

## What I've learned

We're done with the code! Reverse-engineering a library is a great way to upgrade your skills. By diving into the code source of Polyglot, I had the opportunity to enhance my knowledge of:

- How to handle the internationalization in an application
- Prototypes, the prototype chain, and closures
- Regular expressions and their use in `String.prototype.replace`
- Using `call` to apply a function to another object
- The plural rules specific to each language

I'm convinced that the most effective way to learn is by learning from real-world examples and practicing. The theory is great to a certain extent. I highly encourage you to do more reverse-engineering, and I hope that this article gave you the will to do so.
